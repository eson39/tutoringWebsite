# Tutoring Website

A full-stack web application for AP Computer Science A and my first web dev project in high school. The platform enables users to register, log in, schedule tutoring sessions, and manage availability based on their role (Student, Tutor, or Admin). The backend is built using Java Servlets, with JSP for dynamic content, and MySQL for persistent data storage.

## 🔧 Features

- **User Authentication**
  - Secure login and registration
  - Session management using Java `HttpSession`

- **Dynamic Web Pages**
  - Uses JSP for rendering content based on user roles
  - JavaScript and CSS used for interactivity and styling
